# Materials for CoDaS-HEP 2024 Columnar Data Analysis Tutorial


<!-- This repository contains the lecture notebooks and workbook used for [columnar data analysis](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1151367/timetable/#41-columnar-data-analysis), presented at CoDaS-HEP at 13:30pm on July 20, 2023 by Jim Pivarski and Ioana Ifrim.

**Abstract:**

Data analysis languages, such as Numpy, MATLAB, R, IDL, and ADL, are typically interactive with an array-at-a-time interface. Instead of performing an entire analysis in a single loop, each step in the calculation is a separate pass, letting the user inspect distributions each step of the way.

Unfortunately, these languages are limited to primitive data types: mostly numbers and booleans. Variable-length and nested data structures, such as different numbers of particles per event, don't fit this model. Fortunately, the model can be extended.

This tutorial will introduce awkward-array, the concepts of columnar data structures, and how to use them in data analysis, such as computing combinatorics (quantities depending on combinations of particles) without any for loops.

## How to participate 


You don't need to install anything on your computer to participate; You can run the workbook notebook in your browser with JupyterLite:

https://ioanaif.github.io/columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023/lab/index.html


### Running all the notebooks on your personal computer

If you want to install and run the notebooks on your computer (including the lecture notebooks), you can do so by following these steps:


#### 1. Clone the repository

First clone this repository to your local machine via:

```
git clone https://github.com/ioanaif/columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023.git
```

#### 2. Download conda (if you haven't already)

If you do not already have the conda package manager installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).



#### 3. Create a conda environment

Navigate to the  ``columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023`` directory and create a new conda environment with the required
packages via:

```terminal
cd columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

This will create a new conda environment named "columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023".

#### 4. Activate the environment

Next, activate the environment:

```
conda activate columnar-data-analysis-codas-hep-2023
```

#### 5. Launch JupyterLab

Finally, launch JupyterLab with:

```
jupyter lab
```
